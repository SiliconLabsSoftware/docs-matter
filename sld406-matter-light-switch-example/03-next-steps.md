# Next Steps

Now that you have gotten a sense of what goes into making a Matter network, you can begin to customize MADs and other features for your own purposes. The [Developers' Guide](/matter/<docspace-docleaf-version>/matter-developers-guide-overview) contains more detail, and also contains information on a number of special development topics. Your Matter Extension package contains a number of other Matter examples that you can use as a starting point, the first four of which were used in this example.

- Matter SoC Light over Wi-Fi

- Matter SoC Light Switch over Wi-Fi

- Matter SoC Light over Thread

- Matter SoC Light Switch over Thread

- Matter SoC Window Cover over Wi-Fi

- Matter SoC Lock over Wi-Fi

- Matter SoC Thermostat over Wi-Fi

- Matter SoC Window Cover over Thread
