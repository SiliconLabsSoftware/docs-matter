# Introduction

This section is intended to help guide customers to bring their Matter devices to production. Note that the Matter Production uses Silicon Labs [Custom Part Manufacturing Service (CPMS)](https://docs.silabs.com/iot-security/latest/iot-security-cpms/).


The Matter Production Guide includes:

- [**Device Development Prerequisites**](/matter/<docspace-docleaf-version>/matter-device-dev-prereqs) provides the prerequisites and next steps to facilitate your production journey through Matter.
- [**Custom Part Manufacturing Services**](/matter/<docspace-docleaf-version>/matter-using-cpms) describes how Silicon Labs Custom Part Manufacturing Services (CPMS) can be leveraged for Matter Development.
- [**Device Attestation**](/matter/<docspace-docleaf-version>/matter-device-attestation) describes this step and the Matter Certificate roles in the Matter Commissioning process.
- [**Matter Distributed Compliance Ledger**](/matter/<docspace-docleaf-version>/matter-dcl) introduces the Distributed Compliance Ledger (DCL), including DCL roles, what is stored in the DCL, and how to use the DCL in commissioning.
- [**Matter Certification**](/matter/<docspace-docleaf-version>/matter-certification) explains why certification is required, possible certification paths, and a detailed certification flow.
- [**Matter Secure Manufacturing**](/matter/<docspace-docleaf-version>/matter-secure-manufacturing) explores the requirements set by the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA).
