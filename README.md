## How to use the template
1. Import the [basic ruleset](https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/devs-template/blob/main/.github/rulesets/Silabs-basic-public-ruleset.json). Follow the official GitHub [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-rulesets-for-repositories-in-your-organization#importing-a-ruleset).
2. Update if necessary the [issue_templates](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/) and the [pull request template](./.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
3. Create your sw projects under [projects/](projects/) folder.
4. Check [.gitignore](.gitignore) file and modify it if it is necessary
5. Check the [./Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) and extend it if necessary
6. Make sure that the whole project can be compiled with a single "make all" command.  
   also implement "make clean"
7. Fill out the [CODEOWNERS](./.github/CODEOWNERS) file. Here is the official github [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners)
8. Add github app private key for CLA assistant signature. Contact silicon labs github support person for it.

## Hardware requirements
** TODO ** List the required hw components.

## Hardware Setup
** TODO ** Create a block diagram about the components.

## Build environment setup
** TODO ** Add steps here how to create a build environment. Remove the not supported platforms.
### Docker
Using Docker for the build environment has several advantages:
- **Consistency**: Ensures the build environment is the same across all development machines.
- **Isolation**: Keeps the build environment isolated from the host machine, avoiding conflicts.
- **Portability**: Allows the build environment to be easily shared and reproduced.
- **Scalability**: Simplifies scaling the build process across multiple machines.

To set up the Docker-based build environment, follow these steps:
1. Install Docker on your machine. Only Linux and MacOS platforms are supported for now.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Build the Docker image using the provided [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile).
4. Run the Docker container with the necessary configurations.
