# Silicon Labs Matter Over Wi-Fi Example

This document walks through the steps to build the Matter 1.1 applications, such as lighting, light Switch, window covering, thermostat, door lock and On/Off Plug for
EFR32MG24 boards. A complete list of hardware supported for Wi-Fi is included on the [Hardware Requirements page](/matter/<docspace-docleaf-version>/matter-prerequisites/hardware-requirements).

## Step 1: Matter Wi-Fi Prerequisites

Before running the Matter Wi-Fi demo or developing for Wi-Fi make sure that you have all the required hardware and software for each
use case.

1. [Matter Hardware Requirements](/matter/<docspace-docleaf-version>/matter-prerequisites/hardware-requirements)
1. [Matter Software Requirements](/matter/<docspace-docleaf-version>/matter-prerequisites/software-requirements)

## Step 2: Building the chip-tool for Wi-Fi

In order to run the Matter Wi-Fi demo you will need to run the chip-tool on one
of two platforms, either Linux/Mac or Raspberry Pi.

1. [Build Linux Environment](build-chip-env.md)

2. [Build Raspberry-Pi Environment](build-pi-env.md)

## Step 3: Building the Matter Accessory Device (MAD) for Wi-Fi

See [Building a Matter Accessory Device for Wi-Fi with Simplicity Studio](/matter/<docspace-docleaf-version>/matter-wifi-getting-started/04-light-switch-step-by-step-example#creating-the-matter-accessory-devices-ma-ds).

## Step 4: Running the Example Network
This contains instructions to run the Matter Wi-Fi applications using chip-tool
[Running the Matter Demo on EFR32 hosts](run-demo.md)

This contains instructions to run the Matter Wi-Fi demo using chip-tool
running on a Linux Machine (either Laptop or Raspberry Pi) - follow this
after successfully executing the above steps.
