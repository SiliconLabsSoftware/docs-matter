# Silicon Labs Matter Over Wi-Fi Example

This section walks through the steps to build the Matter 1.2 applications, such as lighting, light-switch, window covering, thermostat, door lock, and on/off plug on silicon labs Wi-Fi devices. A complete list of hardware supported for Wi-Fi is included on the [Hardware Requirements page](/matter/<docspace-docleaf-version>/matter-prerequisites/hardware-requirements).

## Step 1: Matter Wi-Fi Prerequisites

Before running the Matter Wi-Fi demo or developing for Wi-Fi, make sure that you have all the required hardware and software for each use case.

1. [Matter Hardware Requirements](/matter/<docspace-docleaf-version>/matter-prerequisites/hardware-requirements)
1. [Matter Software Requirements](/matter/<docspace-docleaf-version>/matter-prerequisites/software-requirements)

## Step 2: Building the chip-tool for Wi-Fi

To run the Matter Wi-Fi demo, you will need to run the chip-tool on one of two platforms, either Linux/Mac or Raspberry Pi. Refer to [Building the Chip-Tool](/matter/<docspace-docleaf-version>/matter-wifi-getting-started-example/build-chip-tool).

## Step 3: Building the Matter Accessory Device (MAD) for Wi-Fi

Refer to [Getting Started with Matter Development](/matter/<docspace-docleaf-version>/matter-wifi-getting-started-example/) for instructions.

## Step 4: Running the Example Network

This contains instructions to run the Matter Wi-Fi applications using chip-tool
[Running the Matter Demo on Matter Accessory Device](/matter/<docspace-docleaf-version>/matter-wifi-run-demo) on a Linux Machine (either Laptop or Raspberry Pi). Follow this after successfully executing the above steps.
