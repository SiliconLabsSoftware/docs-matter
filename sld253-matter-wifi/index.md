# Silicon Labs Matter Over Wi-Fi Example

This document walks through the steps to build the Matter 1.1 applications, such as lighting, light Switch, window covering, thermostat, door lock and On/Off Plug for
EFR32MG24 boards. A complete list of hardware supported for Wi-Fi is included on the [Hardware Requirements page](/matter/<docspace-docleaf-version>/matter-prerequisites/hardware-requirements).

## Step 1: Matter Wi-Fi Prerequisites

Before running the Matter Wi-Fi demo or developing for Wi-Fi make sure that you have all the required hardware and software for each
use case.

1. [Matter Hardware Requirements](/matter/<docspace-docleaf-version>/matter-prerequisites/hardware-requirements)
1. [Matter Software Requirements](/matter/<docspace-docleaf-version>/matter-prerequisites/software-requirements)

## Step 2: Building the chip-tool for Wi-Fi

In order to run the Matter Wi-Fi demo you will need to run the chip-tool on one
of two platforms, either Linux/Mac or Raspberry Pi. Refer to [Building the Chip-Tool](/matter/<docspace-docleaf-version>/matter-wifi-getting-started-example/build-chip-tool). 

## Step 3: Building the Matter Accessory Device (MAD) for Wi-Fi

Refer to [Getting Started with Matter Development](/matter/<docspace-docleaf-version>/matter-wifi-getting-started-example/) for instructions. 

## Step 4: Running the Example Network

This contains instructions to run the Matter Wi-Fi applications using chip-tool
[Running the Matter Demo on Matter Accessory Device](/matter/<docspace-docleaf-version>/matter-wifi-run-demo) on a Linux Machine (either Laptop or Raspberry Pi) - follow this
after successfully executing the above steps.
