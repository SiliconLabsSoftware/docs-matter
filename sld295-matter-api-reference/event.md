# Event

Events are records of past state transitions such as a light device's on-off attribute changing from on to off.

The autogenerated file [```include/AppEvent.h```](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/matter_extension/blob/main/examples/template/include/AppEvent.h) houses the definition of the event object used by the application. It contains the event types, the structures for each event, and event handler.

## Header File

This file contains the high level namespaces and constant definitions for Events. In Simplicity Studio, this will be generated in the autogen/zap-generated/ folder of the matter project.
