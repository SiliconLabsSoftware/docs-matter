# Matter Quick-Start Demos

These demos are the first steps for someone new to Matter to get started quickly.

You should have obtained hardware and installed software as described in the [Overview](/matter/{build-docspace-version}/matter-overview). Once you have done so, you can begin these introductory demos. After going through the basic steps of these demos, proceed to the Matter Light and Switch example for more detailed examples.
