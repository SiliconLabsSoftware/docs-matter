# The Unify Matter Bridge

The Unify Matter Bridge is an application that makes legacy devices, such as
Z-Wave and Zigbee devices, accessible on a Matter fabric. It does so by acting as
an _IoT Service_ in a Unify Framework.

**Support for the Unify Matter Bridge is NOT provided inside Simplicity Studio.** The Unify Matter Bridge must be built out of the GitHub repo located here: [Silicon Labs Matter GitHub Repo](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/matter/). Documentation on using the Unify Matter Bridge is provided here, however the latest documentation on the Unify Matter Bridge is provided directly in the Matter GitHub Repo documentation located here: [Silicon Labs Unify Matter GitHub Documentation](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/matter/blob/latest/docs/silabs/README.md)

This section provides:

- An [**overview**](./readme-overview.md) of the Unify Matter Bridge
- Instructions for [**building the bridge**](./readme-building.md)
- Instructions for [**running the bridge**](./readme-user.md)
