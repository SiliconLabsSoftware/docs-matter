# Overview of Matter Ecosystem

- The Silicon Labs Matter platform supports the most recent versions of the Matter protocol and works with several commercial Matter ecosystems.
- Matter allows multiple ecosystems to work together and control a single, shared Device.
- Silicon Labs Matter devices can be controlled by various Matter enabled Ecosystems.

## Prerequisites

### Ecosystems

"Off the shelf" devices that are compatible with the official implementation of Matter in at least one commercial ecosystem:

- [Google Matter Hubs](https://developers.home.google.com/matter/supported-devices#choosing_a_device_type)
- [Apple Matter](https://www.apple.com/home-app/accessories/)
- [Samsung SmartThings Matter](https://support.smartthings.com/hc/en-us/articles/11219700390804-SmartThings-x-Matter-Integration-)
- [Amazon Alexa Matter](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/smarthome/matter-support.html)

### Smartphone to Control the Ecosystem

- Android smart phone installed with respective Ecosystem mobile apps **Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Samsung Smart Things**.
- Apple iPhone installed with mobile app **Apple Home**.

### Silicon Labs Development Boards

For detailed information about Silicon Labs Development Boards, refer to [Hardware Requirements](/matter/<docspace-docleaf-version>/matter-prerequisites/hardware-requirements).

## Setting up Matter with an Ecosystem and Running a Matter Application

A Matter device can be controlled by single Ecosystem controller and is also interoperable with multiple controllers.

- Follow [Single Controller Setup and Execution](./singlecontroller-ecosystem.md) to operate with single controller
- Follow [Multiple Controller Setup and Execution](./multicontroller-ecosystem.md) to interoperate with multiple controllers
