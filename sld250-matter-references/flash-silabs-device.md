# How to Flash a Silicon Labs Device

Once you have an image built, you can flash it onto your EFR or SiWx917 device (either a development board or the Thunderboard Sense 2) over USB connected to your development machine. This can be done using either Simplicity Studio or the standalone Simplicity Commander.

## Simplicity Studio

Simplicity Studio is a complete development environment and tool suite. It has the ability to discover USB-connected development boards and flash them.
