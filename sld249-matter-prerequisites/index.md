# Prerequisites

If you have already obtained the hardware and software for the [Matter over Thread and Matter over Wi-Fi Quick-Start guides](/matter/{build-docspace-version}/matter-overview), you already have most of what you need. These pages offer more hardware alternatives and provide additional Detail.

These pages explain the [hardware](./hardware-requirements.md) and [software](./software-requirements.md) prerequisites for working with the Silicon Labs Matter products.

The [artifacts page](./matter-artifacts.md) provides links to pre-built software image "artifacts" that can be used to set up the Matter Demo for the Thread and Wi-Fi use cases.
