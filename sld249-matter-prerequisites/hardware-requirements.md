# Matter Hardware Requirements

To run Matter over Thread or over Wi-Fi requires some Silicon Labs hardware in order to run demos and do development. Following are the hardware requirements for both Thread and Wi-Fi use cases broken down by platform and transport protocol.

The following sections describe the hardware that may be used for Matter+OpenThread (Matter Hub and Accessory Device) and for Matter+Wi-Fi (Accessory Device). The EFR32MG24/MG26 is the preferred starting point for Matter MCUs (including the Matter Hub RCP and both Accessory Devices). It provides Secure Vault and can use the internal flash of the device to store an upgrade image. The EFR32MG24/MG26 is recommended for running the [Matter over Thread and Matter over Wi-Fi Quick-Start guides](/matter/{build-docspace-version}/matter-overview).

## Matter Over Thread "Matter Hub" Requirements

If you are running Matter over Thread and do not have a platform on which to run the Open Thread Border Router and chip-tool, Silicon Labs recommends that you run them on a Raspberry Pi. To do so you will need:

**Raspberry Pi**

- Raspberry Pi 4 with an SD card with storage >= 64 GB

The Raspberry Pi 4 is used to run the Open Thread Border Router and the chip-tool. In this documentation the combination of this software on the Raspberry Pi is also called the 'Matter Hub' A software image for the Raspberry Pi is provided on the [Matter Artifacts page](./matter-artifacts.md).

**Radio Co-Processor (RCP)**

The Matter Hub needs a 15.4 RCP in order to create and interact with the Thread network. The RCP can be any Silicon Labs development board that is capable of running the OpenThread RCP firmware. The RCP radio board is connected to the Raspberry Pi via USB.

Over 60 Silicon Labs boards support running the RCP firmware. To build an image for a board that is not listed here, download and build your image in Simplicity Studio. Pre-built OpenThread RCP firmware images are provided for the following boards on the [Matter Artifacts page](./matter-artifacts.md):

**Note:** The EFR32MG24/MG26 is the preferred starting point for Matter MCUs. It provides Secure Vault and can use the internal flash of the device to store an upgrade image.

## Matter Over Thread Accessory Device Requirements

The Matter Accessory Device (MAD) is the actual device that the Matter application firmware (such as the Matter Light or Matter Switch) runs on. Several different platforms for the MAD are supported. Pre-built binary images for the MADs are provided on the [Matter Artifacts page](./matter-artifacts.md). Silicon Labs supports development of MADs for Matter over Thread on the following platforms:

## Matter Over Wi-Fi Accessory Device Requirements

### Matter Over Wi-Fi Accessory Device Requirements for NCP Mode

The Silicon Labs Matter over Wi-Fi NCP mode demo and development requires two boards: the Silicon Labs EFR32 Radio board to run the Matter code and either the RS9116, SiWx917, or WF200 to run the Wi-Fi protocol stack. Pre-built images for the EFR32, and also for SiWx917 or RS9116 connectivity firmware, are provided on the [Matter Artifacts page](./matter-artifacts.md).

**Notes:**

1. The EFR32MG24/MG26 is the preferred starting point for Matter MCUs. It provides Secure Vault and can use the internal flash of the device to store an upgrade image.
2. The WF200 connectivity firmware image is included in the EFR32MG24 images on the [Matter Artifacts page](./matter-artifacts.md) for running with the WF200 in NCP mode. The Matter application downloads the connectivity firmware onto the WF200 on first-time startup.
