# Matter Developer's Guide

The Matter Developer's Guide provides detailed background and instructions for
Matter developers working in either the Thread or Wi-Fi models. The Developer's
Guide contains a deeper dive into development using examples that are similar to
those in the [Quick-Start Guides](/matter/<docspace-docleaf-version>/matter-overview)
as well as other topics of interest.

- [**Prerequisites**](/matter/<docspace-docleaf-version>/matter-prerequisites) provides
a more extensive list of hardware options as well as additional detail on software
prerequisites.
- The [**Matter over Wi-Fi Example**](/matter/<docspace-docleaf-version>/matter-wifi) and
  [**Matter over Thread Example**](/matter/<docspace-docleaf-version>/matter-thread)
  provide much more detail than the quick-start guides.
- The [**Matter Ecosystems**](/matter/<docspace-docleaf-version>/matter-wifi-ecosystems) displays information on various IoT ecoystems and how Silicon Labs' Matter enabled applications integrate within them.
- The [**Unify Matter Bridge**](/matter/<docspace-docleaf-version>/matter-bridge) is an application that makes legacy devices, such as Z-Wave and Zigbee devices, accessible on a Matter fabric. It does so by acting as an IoT Service in a Unify Framework. This application is developed outside of Simplicity Studio. 
- [**Detailed Development Topics**](/matter/<docspace-docleaf-version>/matter-overview-guides) cover
  a number of other topics of interest to developers, including commissioning, security, and
  over-the-air update.
