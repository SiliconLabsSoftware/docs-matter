# Matter Developer's Guide

The Matter Developer's Guide provides detailed background and instructions for Matter developers working in either the Thread or Wi-Fi models. The Developer's Guide contains a deeper dive into development using examples that are similar to those in the [Quick-Start Guides](/matter/{build-docspace-version}/matter-overview)
as well as other topics of interest.

- [**Prerequisites**](/matter/{build-docspace-version}/matter-prerequisites) provides a more extensive list of hardware options as well as additional detail on software prerequisites.
- The [**Matter over Thread Example**](/matter/{build-docspace-version}/matter-thread) and [**Matter over Wi-Fi Example**](/matter/{build-docspace-version}/matter-wifi) provide much more detail than the quick-start guides.
- The [**Matter Ecosystems**](/matter/{build-docspace-version}/matter-ecosystems) displays information on various IoT ecoystems and how Silicon Labs' Matter enabled applications integrate within them.
- [**Detailed Development Topics**](/matter/{build-docspace-version}/matter-overview-guides) cover
  a number of other topics of interest to developers, including commissioning, security, and over-the-air update.
